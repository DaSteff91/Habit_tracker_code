# What can be in here? Or shall this be the "main" file that runs the program?

# e.g. an automatic update feature that automaticall updates the database when opened
# streaks can be set to zero if the tasks are failed/ignored/marked as paused automatically
# does it make sense to automatically refresh the id´s in the database? as i´ve seen they are set manually in the code.
# If an entry gets deleted, the id´s will not be refreshed, so there will be gaps in the id´s. Is this a problem?
# When a set of tasks is still pending from 5 times the repeat cycle, the task will be marked as failed automatically
